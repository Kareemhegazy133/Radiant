# The Reaper Game Project

**The Reaper** â€“ a 2D Role-Playing game developed on a custom-built game engine. This project showcases various advanced game development techniques and design patterns such as Factory Method, Composite Structural Design, Prototype, and Singleton pattern. It also features game systems such as an Entity Component System (ECS), a UI Element System, an Event System, and a Resouce Management System.

## Features

- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: The ECS allows for modular and reusable components, making it easy to extend and maintain game entities.
- **UI Element System**: Dynamic and interactive user interfaces are managed using the UI Element System. This includes buttons, text fields, and other UI components.
- **Event System**: An event handling system enables efficient communication between different parts of the game, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.
- **Custom Game Engine**: The game engine is built using modern C++ standards and design patterns, ensuring high performance and maintainability. It leverages SFML for graphics rendering and other functionalities.
- **Physics Engine**: a Physics engine to simulate AABB collision detection and response.
- **Resource Management System**: a Resource Management System to handle assets like textures, fonts, and sounds, ensuring efficient loading and unloading, reducing memory usage and improving game performance.
